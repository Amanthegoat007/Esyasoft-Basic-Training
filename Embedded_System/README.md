# Assignment1

create a program to blink the LED for 5 times-->

approach:
for 3 thresholds--> there was a delay of 200ms as asked
after that when (counter>threshold)-->
we have increased the delay for 1000ms.

In the end when (counter==max_blinks) we have stopped the blinking and did the countdown for 3 counts with 200ms as delay.
